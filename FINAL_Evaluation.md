# Final Evaluation





#### Technical part



Once the project have been finished, we performed some tests, in order to evaluate both the technical quality of the work and the user experience. 



To do this, we first tried to run private tests (between the member of the group) in two ways: initially "black box" tests on **small parts** of the architecture, to monitor single tasks of the project, in some cases also simulating the parts not in exam, and then we tried with the entire architecture running. 



The results are good: the architecture, despite the **complexity**, performs well in all tasks we designed, and the flow of data is linear. To execute an entire run, from the collection of data to the final result, we need just some seconds, that should be a good result given that we pass through a lot of different nodes during the run.



Moreover, with the actual configuration, we are not experiencing any expenses for traffic consumption, that would increase in the case of modification of the image processing.



#### User experience





About the user experience, we gave the web application to about 20 people, where they loaded an image of their choice, and we collected opinions about the difficulty of the actions, and the satisfaction about the final result provided by our architecture. Our testers compiled a survey about the application: it turned out that almost all of them have been happy about the easiness with which it is possible to approach to the application, and a majority of people have been **satisfied** also by the final artwork, saying that they expected exactly something like the result given.
