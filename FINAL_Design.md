# Final Design



The user approach to our application is really simple: the web application provides a lite landing page, where it is immediately clear what to do and where to go.

We go pretty straightforward: the user can register itself, also through a Google account, and he's ready to use the application. He will go to the "New  DynArtwork" page where he can upload an image of his choice and that's all.

All the work that is behind is completely hidden to the eyes of the user: he won't have to do anything else than **upload** an image and **enjoy** the result.
